For the week of February first to February fith. Tyler and I worked on and completed the app feature list, which contains the different workouts, the different functions, and settings for the app.  I also started the creation of the app in android studio.  However, none of the coding was actually completed.  I also researched how to install and use android studio including the subjects of creating an app, coding an app, and running the app on a virtual machine.  We also came up with some alternate features including a time exclusion feature, and possibly a step counter.  I installed the java SDK in order to properly run android studio and create the app.  Tyler mainly worked on the workouts and different muscle group organization.  During this week I installed git bash for my computer and learned somewhat how to use it.  I still need help working it. two more

For the week of February 8th to the date of february 12th. Tyler and I continued to learn about how android studio functions.  None of the actual coding has been completed but the folder has been created for the app.  I am still currently learning how to work the ins and outs of android studio.  I have been experiencing problems getting it to open and am currently working on how to solve that.  Tyler has been also learning how to work android studio but I do not know how much progress he has made in his endevours.  I am also experiencing problems with git hub, I do not know if it is me not entering commands correctly or if it is the program itself.  So far there has been little progress in making the actual app and I hope to fix this problem in the next week or so, hopefully

For the week of February 15th to the date of February 19th, Tyler and I furthered our research into the workings of the program known as android studio, I myself have been struggling to understand how to work it and the guides i have been looking up on the internet are not helping as much as i would like them to.  Tyler's progress is unknown to me but i am sure he is probably doing better than i am on getting adroid studio to work.  I am still having git hub problems and i do not quite understand what is wrong but i am trying to resolve them.  My development journal is not very helpful seeing as how there has not been much or any progress at all.  hopefully more progress is made next week and Tyler and I will be able to meet our first deliverable.  End of entry.

For the week of February twenty second to the date of february twenty sixth Tyler and I have continued to attempt to learn how to use android studio.  I myself have been finding it very challenging and am having trouble working it.  I have also resolved my git hub problems and so this development journal should be added and up to date as of this entry.  I have also added the feature list to the git hub repository.  Not much progress has been made towards the actual app but i still hope that we will be able to get the app somewhat made at some point.  Tyler and I plan to try and make some progress this weekend on the app, I do not know whether we will be successful but we will have at least made some effort.  This is my development journal for this week and is hopefully now over or equal to 150 words.

For the week of february twenty eight to the date of march fourth Tyler and I continued to further our education and knowledge of the program know as android studio.  The instructor by the name of Robert Schreiber introduced Tyler and I to an online course in the field of android studio.  The online course is run through a website that goes by the name of Udacity.  The course is absolutley free and consists of many videos explaining the concepts of android studio and how to use some of its parts.  I have resolved my git hub issues and hopefully this will be pushed into the repository on time.  I plan to watch the videos during the free time i have a home and hopefully in class as well.  However, I will not be here for the next work day due to an Acedemic Decathlon meeting.  This concludes my journal entry for the week.

For the week of march 7th to the date of march 11th Tyler and I continued to learn about the inner workings and how to use android studio.  I was gone for the friday of the 11th so i was not able to work with him at all this week but on the bright side i placed gold in science for the state competition of academic decathlon and bronze in math.  I am continuing to watch the udacity videos on android studio and am finding them way more helpful than the text document we were reading before hand.  The udacity videos are very helpful and I plan to continue using them for the duration of the project.  Tyler and I hope to finish the udacity videos by the end of this week and begin to actually develop the app and hope it doesnt turn out to be a complete failure.

For the week of March 14th to the date of March 18th Tyler and I continued to work on our project, I have recently learned how to add the on click commands to the xml files.  Tyler has completed most if not all the xml files and we have the layout almost completly done.  The on click commands can be done in two different ways and Tyler and I are currently debating on which style to use.  I hope to use the on click command that runs through the xml coding and runs a method in a seperate activity.  The activities still need to be made and coded in order to run the appropriate xml files.  Each activity will need to be linked to an xml file and I plan on learning that next week. This concludes my development journal for this week and it should now be equal to or greater than the 150 word requirement given by Schreiber.

For the week of March 28th to the date of April 1st.  Tyler and I have gotten much done.  We have succesfully completed the layout of our app and are now working on implementing the onclick commands for the buttons.  We have recently encountered a problem with the git functionality on android studio but we plan on having schreiber help us with that on monday.  There appears to be a root problem with some of the files but we hope to figure that out before monday.  Over the weekend I also plan to resolve the class issues, all the class names are lower cased and I need to go through and capitalize every one of them.  That sounds like a pain but it needs to be done.  This shall conclude my development journal for this week and it should now finally be equal to the one hundred fifty word constraint.
